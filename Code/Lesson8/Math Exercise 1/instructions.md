# Math Exercise 1
## Instructions
Modify the section of code in ```main.js``` as denoted by the comments.

Use the Math properties and methods to implement the equation of volume of a sphere
- // v = 4/3∙𝜋∙r^3, where v is volume of sphere and r is radius of sphere


Edit the code after line 20, so that the correct property: value pairs are printed. 

## Running the Test
To test if your code is correct, run the test with the following commands in terminal:
```bash
node test.js
```

The result for each test case will be printed in the terminal as ```Test passed``` or ```Test failed```.
