# Arrays Map Exercise 1
## Instructions
Modify the section of code in ```main.js``` as denoted by the comments.

Use Array Map to determine if the number is a even number or odd number
- If the number is even, return 'even', otherwise return 'odd'
- Store the result in a new array called results

Edit the code after line 20, so that the correct values are printed. 

## Running the Test
To test if your code is correct, run the test with the following commands in terminal:
```bash
node test.js
```

The result for each test case will be printed in the terminal as ```Test passed``` or ```Test failed```.
