# Capstone

## Instructions

Modify the section of code in ```main.js``` as denoted by the comments.

With what we've learnt so far let's make something useful. For the next 2 lessons, we will be building a queue-tracking app. Here's the brief description of the functions needed:

1. Add a new person at the end of the queue
2. Allow us to remove a person from the queue
3. Allow us to advance the queue (first person in queue is served/leaves, everyone else moves up)
4. Update the details of a particular index in the queue (person in queue swaps with another person)
5. Allows us to sort the queue

The program should take inputs to allow the actions above and print the table at the end of each action

## Running the Test

To test if your code is correct, run the test with the following commands in terminal:

```bash
node main.js
```
