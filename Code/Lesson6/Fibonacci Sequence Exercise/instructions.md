# Fibonacci Sequence Exercise
## Instructions
Modify the section of code in ```main.js``` as denoted by the comments.

Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones
- Create an array “sequence” which contains numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
- For each iteration add the next number to the array “sequence”
- Break out of the loop when you have 15 items in the array, or if the latest item is more than 400 (remember to still insert this latest item into the array)
- The first 2 values, 0 and 1, are already given and inserted into the array.


Edit the code after line 19 to print the correct message. 

## Running the Test
To test if your code is correct, run the test with the following commands in terminal:
```bash
node test.js
```

The result for each test case will be printed in the terminal as ```Test passed``` or ```Test failed```.
